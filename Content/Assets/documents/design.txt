Brief discription of design idea behind this game.
==================================================

This game is one that is rising out of me messing around with Java and LibGDX. This 'design document'
will only give a brief sysnopsis of the ideas I have for it.

This game will be a 2D platformer type game.

The main character has several minor tasks and one main task.

Main Task:- Rescue a group of local villagers from the jail cells hidden throughout the levels. To open a jail, a key must first be found.

Minor tasks:- Retrieve 8 Potions, 8 Ancient Runes, and 8 Spell Books from the levels

There will be a number of hazards, monsters and enemy characters to avoid.

In various places with the game, the Hero will encounter characters who he will be able to talk to. They
will provide tips and helpful advice. Some of them may choose not to talk, or will impart useless information.

Several areas of the map can only be accessed via hidden entrances.
